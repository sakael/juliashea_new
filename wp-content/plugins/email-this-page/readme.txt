= Privacy & Data =

Emails are sent from our server; this plugin “phones home”. Personal information & Data is sent to our servers. Here’s what we do with it.

Our Fundamental Principles: 

* **We do not sell data.** Period.
* **We do not share data,** unless compelled by the law.
* **We do not ask for personal information,** unless it's needed to provide a service.
* **We don’t store personal information,**  unless required for the on-going operation of service.

Specifically, here’s what we do with the data and information:

**Email Address & Content get permanently deleted**  In order to send the email, we need to store the email address and message on our server. After the email has been sent and found not to be a spammer, the email address is permanently deleted. 

**Server log files get created and deleted.** Browsers and Servers pass non-personally-identifying information, such as the browser type, language, referrer, and the date/time. We may use this data to analyze how the service is being used. Non-personally-identifying aggregate data may get published, e.g., by a report on trends in the usage of the service.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I set the share by email button to align left / right and it doesn't align right! =
Check whether your theme includes the [required CSS class](http://codex.wordpress.org/CSS#WordPress_Generated_Classes), InstaEmail uses these to align your button. If that doesn't work for you, uncheck the "Add CSS to Pages" checkbox and style the button yourself.

= I'm manually adding the email this page button but it's aligning wrong! =
If you're getting unexpected results, you might want to set Horizontal Alignment to "None".

= I still need help! =
